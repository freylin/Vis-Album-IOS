How to start on my Mac: first, double click `visAlbum.xcodeproj` to launch the Xcode. If you want to run in the simulator, choose the option `iOS simulator` . If you want to run on the real device, choose the option `device` . Then click the button `run` or press `command+R` to launch the app.



NOTE: This app is developed for iPhone, requiring iOS 9+. Because my developer account is only for individual use, so it is not allowed to be put on App Store. And it can only run on my registered device due to the verification restriction of Apple Inc.
